A Linked list is a dynamic , non -contigous linear data structure where each element (called a  node) contains
data and a pointer (or reference) to the next node in the sequence . Unlike arrays, linked lists do not
require a predefined size, allowing dynamic memory allocation.


There are three types of Linked list
1. Singly Linked list
2. Doubly Linked list
3. Circular Linked list
